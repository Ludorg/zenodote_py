Zenodote is a "physical books" üìö library manager based on web-queries using their ISBN (International Standard Book Number).

As detailled in paragraph "[about this project](#about-this-project)", this is a side project to self-learn and experiment different web technologies, not a fully featured product. It is written in Python and uses [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).

## Prerequisites

### Code edition

Zenodote library manager (zndt-lm) is developped in Python 3 with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its powerful [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). Code is formatted with autopep8 (default value). [Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) is performed with pylint. The configuration for this editor is given below. These parameters are workspace settings.

```json
{
    "python.testing.unittestArgs": [
        "-v",
        "-s",
        "./zenodote_py/app",
        "-p",
        "*test.py"
    ],
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": true,
    "python.pythonPath": "/opt/python/latest/bin/python3.8",
    "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
        "./zenodote_py/app",
    ],
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true
}
```

[autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) may be installed with the following command, which was generated by VSCode:

```bash
/opt/python/latest/bin/python3.8 -m pip install -U autopep8 --user
```

[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) may also be installed with pip as below, (this command is generated by VSCode):

```bash
/opt/python/latest/bin/python3.8 -m pip install -U pylint --user
```

### Development environment

Zenodote library manager (zndt-lm) runs on Linux. It was initially developed on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS in a VM running in Hyper-V. Migration to GitHub was made with [Visual Studio Online](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/), the cloud-powered dev environments.


## About this project

### Some words on Z√©nodote the librarian

Z√©nodote is the french name of Zenodotus, who was the first superintendent of the Library of Alexandria.

_Z√©nodote, en grec ancien ŒñŒ∑ŒΩœåŒ¥ŒøœÑŒøœÇ / Z√™n√≥dotos (320‚Äì240 av. J.-C.), grammairien alexandrin.
Il est le premier biblioth√©caire de la biblioth√®que d'Alexandrie. Ptol√©m√©e II Philadelphe a recours √† ses services, ainsi qu'√† ceux d'Alexandre l'√âtolien et Lycophron de Chalcis pour mettre au point des √©ditions critiques des grands po√®tes grecs. Alors que ses coll√®gues prennent en charge respectivement les trag√©dies et les com√©dies, Z√©nodote s'attaque √† l'≈ìuvre d'Hom√®re. Il publie une Recension (ŒîŒπœåœÅŒ∏œâœÉŒπœÇ / Di√≥rth√¥sis) ainsi qu'un Glossaire (ŒìŒª·ø∂œÉœÉŒ±Œπ / Gl√¥ssai) de l‚ÄôIliade et de l‚ÄôOdyss√©e, et rejette les Hymnes hom√©riques comme √©tant post√©rieurs._

### Origin of Zenodote library manager (zndt-lm)

Zenodote was my "pet project" which started in 2012/2013.
It initially aimed to be an ebook library manager.
A first and draft version of a client/server application was developed.
Server was written in C++ and client was a Java application which should also have been targeted Android.
This source code is not in this repo.

This early version was cancelled in 2013 and the project was in a frozen state until 2017.
Zenodote then became a "physical books" library manager based on web-queries using their ISBN (International Standard Book Number).

This side project was a practical way to self-learn and experiment different web technologies.
Some JavaScript tests were made with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and then in Python with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Finally, mid-2019 Python with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) was chosen. Only this source code is stored in this public repo.

This code was initialy managed in a private [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/) repo: <https://dev.azure.com/ludorg/>. For public repo, GitHub was selected. There is no common history between these two Git repositories.
